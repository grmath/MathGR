MathGR
======

MathGR is a package for GR calculation, written in Mathematica. 

The manual of the package is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1295

Note: if you download (instead of clone) the package and then unzip, the folder name will include a version number, something like `MathGR-0.1.1`. Please change it to exactly `MathGR` before usage. This is because `Mathematica` requires the folder name to be exactly the same as the package name. Otherwise the packages cannot be properly loaded.
